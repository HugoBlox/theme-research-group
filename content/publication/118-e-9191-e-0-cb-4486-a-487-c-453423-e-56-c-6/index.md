abstract: 'Objectives: In this data collation study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive
  database describing the epidemic trends and responses during the first wave of coronavirus
  disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the main provinces in China. Methods: From mid-January
  to March 2020, we extracted publicly available data regarding the spread and control
  of COVID-19 from 31 provincial health authorities and major media outlets in mainland
  China. Based on these data, we conducted descriptive analyses of the epidemic in
  the six most-affected provinces. Results: School closures, travel restrictions,
  community-level lockdown, and contact tracing were introduced concurrently around
  late January but subsequent epidemic trends differed among provinces. Compared with
  Hubei, the other five most-affected provinces reported a lower crude case fatality
  ratio and proportion of critical and severe hospitalised cases. From March 2020,
  as the local transmission of COVID-19 declined, switching the focus of measures
  to the testing and quarantine of inbound travellers may have helped to sustain the
  control of the epidemic. Conclusions: Aggregated indicators of case notifications
  and severity distributions are essential for monitoring an epidemic. A publicly
  available database containing these indicators and information regarding control
  measures is a useful resource for further research and policy planning in response
  to the COVID-19 epidemic.'
