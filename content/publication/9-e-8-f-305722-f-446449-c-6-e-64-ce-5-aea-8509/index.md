abstract: During the second half of 2020, many European governments responded to the
  resurging transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with wide-ranging non-pharmaceutical interventions
  (NPIs). These efforts were often highly targeted at the regional level and included
  fine-grained NPIs. This paper describes a new dataset designed for the accurate
  recording of NPIs in Europe's second wave to allow precise modelling of NPI effectiveness.
  The dataset includes interventions from 114 regions in 7 European countries during
  the period from the 1st August 2020 to the 9th January 2021. The paper includes
  NPI definitions tailored to the second wave following an exploratory data collection.
  Each entry has been extensively validated by semi-independent double entry, comparison
  with existing datasets, and, when necessary, discussion with local epidemiologists.
  The dataset has considerable potential for use in disentangling the effectiveness
  of NPIs and comparing the impact of interventions across different phases of the
  pandemic.
