abstract: Enzymatic reactions in living cells are highly dynamic but simultaneously tightly regulated. Enzyme engineers seek to construct multienzyme complexes to prevent intermediate diffusion, to improve product yield, and to control the flux of metabolites. Here we choose a pair of short peptide tags (RIAD and RIDD) to create scaffold-free enzyme assemblies to achieve these goals. In vitro, assembling enzymes in the menaquinone biosynthetic pathway through RIADâ€“RIDD interaction yields protein nanoparticles with varying stoichiometries, sizes, geometries, and catalytic efficiency. In Escherichia coli, assembling the last enzyme of the upstream mevalonate pathway with the first enzyme of the downstream carotenoid pathway leads to the formation of a pathway node, which increases carotenoid production by 5.7 folds. The same strategy results in a 58% increase in lycopene production in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This work presents a simple strategy to impose metabolic control in biosynthetic microbe factories.
