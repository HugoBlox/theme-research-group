abstract: In this letter, we introduce a combined polarization and fluorescence imaging technique for the measurement of fluorescence yield on the surface of turbid media. We use the cross-polarization method to reject the specular reflection and enhance the diffusive backscattering from the turbid media. It has been found that the ratio image of fluorescence versus cross-polarized reflection is not sensitive to the geometry of fluorescence excitation and illumination, and provides a map of fluorescence yield on the surface of imaged subject. The technique reported in this letter may potentially solve the problem for imaging of early cancers which usually start from the superficial layer of tissue and have the fluorescence yield lower than surrounding normal tissue.
