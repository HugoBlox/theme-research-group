abstract: Optical deep-brain imaging in vivo at high resolution has remained a great challenge over the decades. Two-photon endomicroscopy provides a minimally invasive approach to image buried brain structures, once it is integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens embedded in the brain. However, its imaging resolution and field of view are compromised by the intrinsic aberrations of the GRIN lens. Here, we develop a two-photon endomicroscopy by adding adaptive optics based on direct wavefront sensing, which enables recovery of diffraction-limited reso-lution  in  deep-brain  imaging.  A  new  precompensation  strategy  plays  a  critical  role  to  correct  aberrations  over  large volumes and achieve rapid random-access multiplane imaging. We investigate the neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, a critical deep brain structure, and reveal the relationship between the somatic and dendritic activity of pyramidal neurons.
