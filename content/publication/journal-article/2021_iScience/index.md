abstract: Neuronal activation is often accompanied by the regulation of cerebral hemodynamics via a process known as neurovascular coupling (NVC) which is essential for proper brain function and has been observed to be disrupted in a variety of neuropathologies. A comprehensive understanding of NVC requires imaging capabilities with high spatiotemporal resolution and a field-of-view that spans different orders of magnitude. Here, we present an approach for concurrent multi-contrast mesoscopic and two-photon microscopic imaging of neurovascular dynamics in the cortices of live mice. We investigated the spatiotemporal correlation between sensory-evoked neuronal and vascular responses in the auditory cortices of living mice using four imaging modalities. Our findings unravel drastic differences in the NVC at the regional and microvascular levels and the distinctive effects of different brain states on NVC. We further investigated the brain-state-dependent changes of NVC in large cortical networks and revealed that anesthesia and sedation caused spatiotemporal disruption of NVC.
