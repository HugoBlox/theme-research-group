abstract: Hippocampal synaptic plasticity is important for learning and memory formation. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a specific form of synaptic plasticity that is induced upon prolonged changes in neuronal activity to maintain network homeostasis. While astrocytes are important regulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity, it is largely unclear how they interact with neurons to regulate synaptic plasticity at the circuit level. Here, we show that neuronal activity blockade selectively increases the expression and secretion of IL-33 (interleukin-33) by astrocytes in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) subregion. This IL-33 stimulates an increase in excitatory synapses and neurotransmission through the activation of neuronal IL-33 receptor complex and synaptic recruitment of the scaffold protein PSD-95. We found that acute administration of tetrodotoxin in hippocampal slices or inhibition of hippocampal CA1 excitatory neurons by optogenetic manipulation increases IL-33 expression in CA1 astrocytes. Furthermore, IL-33 administration in vivo promotes the formation of functional excitatory synapses in hippocampal CA1 neurons, whereas conditional knockout of IL-33 in CA1 astrocytes decreases the number of excitatory synapses therein. Importantly, blockade of IL-33 and its receptor signaling in vivo by intracerebroventricular administration of its decoy receptor inhibits homeostatic synaptic plasticity in CA1 pyramidal neurons and impairs spatial memory formation in mice. These results collectively reveal an important role of astrocytic IL-33 in mediating the negative-feedback signaling mechanism in homeostatic synaptic plasticity, providing insights into how astrocytes maintain hippocampal network homeostasis.
