 abstract = {European governments use non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
to control resurging waves of COVID-19. However, they only have
outdated estimates for how effective individual NPIs were in the
first wave. We estimate the effectiveness of 17 NPIs in Europe's
second wave from subnational case and death data by introducing
a flexible hierarchical Bayesian transmission model and
collecting the largest dataset of NPI implementation dates
across Europe. Business closures, educational institution
closures, and gathering bans reduced transmission, but reduced
it less than they did in the first wave. This difference is
likely due to organisational safety measures and individual
protective behaviours-such as distancing-which made various
areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of
closing them. Specifically, we find smaller effects for closing
educational institutions, suggesting that stringent safety
measures made schools safer compared to the first wave.
Second-wave estimates outperform previous estimates at
predicting transmission in Europe's third wave.},
