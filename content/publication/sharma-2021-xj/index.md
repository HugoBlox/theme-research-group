abstract: European governments use non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control
  resurging waves of COVID-19. However, they only have outdated estimates for how
  effective individual NPIs were in the first wave. We estimate the effectiveness
  of 17 NPIs in Europe's second wave from subnational case and death data by introducing
  a flexible hierarchical Bayesian transmission model and collecting the largest dataset
  of NPI implementation dates across Europe. Business closures, educational institution
  closures, and gathering bans reduced transmission, but reduced it less than they
  did in the first wave. This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures
  and individual protective behaviours-such as distancing-which made various areas
  of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them. Specifically,
  we find smaller effects for closing educational institutions, suggesting that stringent
  safety measures made schools safer compared to the first wave. Second-wave estimates
  outperform previous estimates at predicting transmission in Europe's third wave.
