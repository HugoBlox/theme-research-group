abstract: Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus1 (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread
  outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics. In response, many European
  countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as
  closure of schools and national lockdowns. We study the impact of major interventions
  across 11 European countries for the period from the start of COVID-19 until the
  4th of May 2020 when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards
  from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior,
  allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of
  information between countries with both individual and shared effects on the reproduction
  number. Pooling allows more information to be used, helps overcome data idiosyncrasies,
  and enables more timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological
  parameters such as the infection fatality rate, does not include importation or
  subnational variation and assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an
  immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior. Amidst
  the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that is incomplete, with systematic
  biases in reporting, and subject to future consolidation. We estimate that, for
  all the countries we consider, current interventions have been sufficient to drive
  the reproduction number $$R_t$$Rt below 1 (probability $$R_tbackslash,$$Rt< 1.0
  is 99.9%) and achieve epidemic control. We estimate that, across all 11 countries,
  between 12 and 15 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4th
  May, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population. Our results show that
  major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown in particular have had a large
  effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to
  keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.
