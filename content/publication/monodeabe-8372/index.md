abstract: Following initial declines, in mid 2020 a resurgence in transmission of
  novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in the US and Europe. As COVID19 disease
  control efforts are re-intensified, understanding the age demographics driving transmission
  and how these affect the loosening of interventions is crucial. We analyze aggregated,
  age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals in the US and
  link these mechanistically to age-specific COVID-19 mortality data. We estimate
  that as of October 2020, individuals aged 20-49 are the only age groups sustaining
  resurgent SARS-CoV-2 transmission with reproduction numbers well above one, and
  that at least 65 of 100 COVID-19 infections originate from individuals aged 20-49
  in the US. Targeting interventions – including transmission-blocking vaccines –
  to adults aged 20-49 is an important consideration in halting resurgent epidemics
  and preventing COVID-19-attributable deaths.
