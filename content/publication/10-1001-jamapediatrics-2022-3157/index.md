abstract: The availability of new excess mortality data enables us to update global
  minimum estimates of COVID-19 orphanhood and caregiver death among children. Consequences
  for children can be devastating, including institutionalization, abuse, traumatic
  grief, mental health problems, adolescent pregnancy, poor educational outcomes,
  and chronic and infectious diseases. Global totals and country comparisons were
  previously hampered by inconsistencies in COVID-19 testing and incomplete death
  reporting. The new orphanhood estimates derived here based on excess deaths provide
  a comprehensive measure of COVID-19’s long-term impact on orphanhood and caregiver
  loss.
