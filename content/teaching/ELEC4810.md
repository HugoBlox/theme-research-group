# Course Description:  
This course introduces electrical and physics students to the concepts underlying the design of medical electronic devices.  
Biomedical applications from electrical, chemical, and mechanical engineering perspectives will be discussed in both descriptive and quantitative terms.  
Methods for acquiring and processing signals from the human body are studied mostly at the system level, but practical examples of the circuit-level design of medical devices are also presented. The instrumentation of non-invasive devices will be emphasized
