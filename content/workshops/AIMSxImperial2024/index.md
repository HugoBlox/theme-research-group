title: "AIMS-Imperial workshop: Modern Statistics and Machine Learning for Global Health"
subtitle: ''
summary: 'In February 2024, 4 members of the Machine Learning and Global Health Network visited AIMS Rwanda to deliver a 3-day workshop on modern methods at the intersection of epidemiology, statistical modelling and computer science, including probabilistic programming using Stan, computationally efficient non-parametric Bayesian inference, statistical techniques for infectious disease modelling and public health, and phylogenetics.'
