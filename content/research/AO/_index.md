***1. AO in deep brain imaging***
<br />
Breakthroughs in imaging technology have been the primary
driving force of new biological discoveries. Optical microscopy
has greatly facilitated biomedical research in recent
decades, with its ability to provide structural and functional information
in living specimens at high spatiotemporal resolution.
However, optical aberration and scattering occur as light travels
through and interacts with inhomogeneous biological tissues, such
as the mammalian brain, fundamentally limiting the performance
of optical microscopy in both resolution and depth. 
Adaptive optics (AO) compensation of specimen-induced
aberrations is essential to recover optimal imaging performance
at depth. The desired excitation wavefront can be determined
using either direct or indirect approaches. Direct wavefront
sensing of a fluorescent guide star inside biological tissue enables
rapid measurement of aberration, but it depends on quasi-ballistic
photons for wavefront sensing, and the performance degrades
rapidly at deptH. In indirect sensing approaches, various algorithms
are designed to determine the optimal corrective wavefront.
The methods are more suitable for opaque tissues but are 
usually time-consuming and mainly deal with optical aberrations.

<br />

In this work, we developed an AO 3PM based on a method
termed ALPHA-FSS, or Î±-FSS. The method allows accurate measurement
and corrective updates of both aberrations and scattering in
highly turbid tissue at great depth. 

***2. AO in retinal imaging***

![screen reader text](retinal.jpg "AO enhanced retino imaging")
Blindness is a major public health issue globally. In vivo longitudinal 
imaging of retina at subcellular resolution could provide a powerful tool
in discovering the progression of retinal diseases and biological basis. 
The mouse eye has unique optical property of larger (~0.5) numerical 
aperture (NA) compared with that of human eye (~0.2). However, the major 
challenge is the large optical aberration of mouse eye which blurs the
excitation laser focus and lowers the imaging resolution. With the help 
of adaptive optics, the mouse eye aberration can be corrected and we can
use this technology to in vivo visualize the progression of retinal 
diseases in mouse model.
