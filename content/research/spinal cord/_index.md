Nonlinear optical (NLO) imaging technology encompasses a wide group of nonlinear optical phenomena including two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), second harmonic generation (SHG), and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). Compared to traditional optical imaging technologies like confocal laser scanning microscopy, TPEF microscopy has higher imaging resolution, lower photo-toxicity, and larger imaging penetration depth. SHG microscopy could be employed to realize the imaging of non-centrosymmetric structures like collagen fibers in biological samples with no photo-toxicity effect. Moreover, SRS enables label-free imaging of biological molecules with specific vibrational frequencies, thus could be a useful technique to investigate the biochemical properties of different biological process. Multimodal nonlinear optical imaging technology which combines TPEF and SHG together with SRS could provide biological information from different view angles, thus is of great significance especially for the case of biological tissue study in vivo.

Axons in the spinal cord have limited regeneration ability after SCI compared with the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Myelin and macrophages both play an important role in axonal regeneration while their specific role at different injury stage remains elusive. Our developed multimodal nonlinear optical microscope combing TPEF, SHG and SRS could realize visualization of different cell interactions and biochemical dynamics in mice spinal cord, which could help to reveal the mechanism behind spinal cord poor intrinsic regeneration capacity after SCI and give new insights into the early treatment of the injured spinal cord.
