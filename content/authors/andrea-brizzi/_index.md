I am a PhD student at Imperial College London, part of the StatML program. My research lies at the intersection of Bayesian modelling and phylogenetics, and tries to describe changes in the Sub-Saharan HIV epidemic. 
Further, I am interested in the estimation of HIV infection dates based on viral sequencing data.
