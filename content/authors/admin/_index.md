I am an Assistant Professor at [University of Copenhagen (UCPH)](https://publichealth.ku.dk/), where I am primarily working at intersection of public health, machine learning and Bayeasian modelling. Before this I was fortunate enough spend my Post-doc years at [School of Public Health, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health), where  I worked primarily with [Professor Samir Bhatt](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=tL0x_vUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Seth Flaxman](http://sethrf.com/). I am working with colleagues at Imperial College London, University of Oxford and UCPH to model spread of COVID-19. I did my Ph.D. at [Research School of Computer Science, The Australian National University](https://cs.anu.edu.au/) under the supervision of [Professor Lexing Xie](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/) and [Dr Marian-Andrei Rizoiu](http://rizoiu.eu/). I have also worked with [Professor Wray Buntine](https://topicmodels.org/about/) at Monash University.

My research focuses on applying and developing statistical machine learning techniques for the broader and messier world of science and public policy, especially global health. I develop flexible and scalable models for understanding various spatiotemporal data, for example, epidemics (COVID-19, Malaria, HIV) and crime. For my doctorate, I  built models for understanding the evolution of popularity in social media. My work focused on algorithms to model point processes with classical machine learning techniques as well as using modern deep learning networks, mainly recurrent networks.
