 My main research is focused on prediction modelling of adverse outcomes in vulnerable individuals challenged by life-stressors. My primary interest lies in the use of longitudinal, time-series data, their properties and dynamics in classic and machine learning prognostic models. I am also fascinated by the implementation, understanding, and utility of various sources of data that capture further layers of the complexity of human health. My PhD project is placed in the intersection of epidemiology, statistics and machine learning.
