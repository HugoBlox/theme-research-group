I am a senior researcher in the Data Science and its Applications department at the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), based in Kaiserslautern.
My work touches on a number of areas in the application of data science to health research, including use of smartphones for patient self-reporting of symptoms.
I am also interested in meta-level questions such as reproducibility, synthetic data generation, data science ethics and the influence of bibliometrics on research funding, the latter being the subject of my PhD.
