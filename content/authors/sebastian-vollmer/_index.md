I am a professor of applications of machine learning at the [Technical University of Kaiserslautern](https://www.informatik.uni-kl.de/en/) and the [German Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/). I am also
an associate professor in statistics and mathematics in the [Mathematics Insitute](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/) and the [department of statistics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/)  at the University of Warwick.  I used be  the director of data study groups at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). As well as a Co-Director [health and medical sciences research programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/health-and-medical-sciences).
My research interests lie at the interface of computational statistics and machine learning, with a particular focus on real-world applications.  I've worked in application areas ranging from transport, energy, and in particular health and well-being.

Before joining the University of Warwick, I was a lecturer in Statistics at the University of Oxford.  Prior to this I undertook postdoctoral research with [Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) (Oxford) and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) (Oxford).  I completed my PhD in September 2013 in Mathematics at the University of Warwick supervised by [Andrew Stuart](http://stuart.caltech.edu/) and [Martin Hairer](http://www.hairer.org/).
