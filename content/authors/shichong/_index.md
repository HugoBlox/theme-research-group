I am a Ph.D. candidate at Simon Fraser University in the department of computing science supervised by [Ke Li](https://www.sfu.ca/~keli//). I received my Master's degree from UC San Diego and Bachelor's degree in computer science from University of Toronto. My research focuses on generative model and 3D neural rendering. My goal is to develop methods that can better aid 3D object generation and animation.
