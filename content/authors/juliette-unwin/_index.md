I am a Lecturer in Statistical Science in the School of Mathematics at the University of Bristol. I am interested in developing and applying novel methods for infectious disease outbreak analysis to help inform policy makers in real time.  My current research focuses on developing spatial temporal renewal based transmission models alongside estimating the number of children affected by COVID-19 and crises.
