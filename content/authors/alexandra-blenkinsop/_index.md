I am a Research Associate based in the statistics section at Imperial College London. My research uses viral sequence data, clinical and epidemiological patient data to characterise HIV transmission at population-level, which can be used to guide public health interventions. I have also been involved in research relating to COVID-19, with a focus on children losing parents and caregivers. More broadly, I am interested in studying health inequalities, to inform policy seeking to close these gaps.

I have collaborated with numerous partners including the HIV Transmission Elimination Team (H-TEAM), the Amsterdam Institute of Global Health and Development, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalised Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA) HIV consortium, the Botswana-Havard AIDS Institute Partnership and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
