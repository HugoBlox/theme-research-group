I am a Postdoc working with the HIV Transmission Elimination Team at the Amsterdam Institute of Global Health and Development. My research involves using viral sequence data and patient data to characterise HIV transmission and monitor the effectiveness of interventions at city-level. My research interests include phylogenetics, mathematical modelling and Bayesian methods.


I am also involved in research relating to COVID-19, with a focus on children losing parents and caregivers and disparities across the US.
