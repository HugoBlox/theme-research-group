I am a post-doc at Professor [Seth Flaxman](https://sethrf.com)'s lab at Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. I completed my PhD degree in Statistics at London School of Economics (LSE), supervised by Professor [Wicher Bergsma](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/wicher-bergsma). My research interests include: Gaussian process regression, kernel methods, spatio-temporal analysis, statistical modelling, Bayesian inference and efficient and interpretable statistical learning. I am particularly interested in applications to the areas of environmental studies, and epidemiology. Prior to starting my PhD study, I was working as a statistician at the pharmaceutical industry. I completed my Master's degree in Statistics at LSE, and my Bachelor's in Economics and Political Science at Waseda University in Tokyo. See my [personal website](https://sahokoishida.github.io/).
