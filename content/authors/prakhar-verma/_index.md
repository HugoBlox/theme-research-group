I am a machine learning Ph.D. student with <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/" target="blank">Arno Solin's</a> research group at <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en" target="blank">Aalto University, Finland</a>. I am broadly interested in probabilistic modelling and efficient inference techniques. For my masterâ€™s thesis, I researched on developing variational inference techniques for non-linear SDEs. Recently, my work has focused on sequential decision-making models that need computationally efficient and well-calibrated uncertainty.
