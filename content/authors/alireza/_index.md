I am a PhD student at the APEX Lab, supervised by Dr. Ke Li at Simon Fraser University in beautiful Vancouver. I hold undergraduate degrees in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering from AmirKabir University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. My research focuses on neural rendering, generative models, and machine learning.
