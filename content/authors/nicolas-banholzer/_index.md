My work involves modelling of transmissions risks of respiratory infectious diseases (primarily SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and infection control measures. I am generally interested in Bayesian modelling, in particular Bayesian hierarchical and latent variable models.
