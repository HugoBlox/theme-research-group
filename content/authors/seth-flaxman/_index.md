I am an associate professor at the University of Oxford in the Department of Computer Science and a tutorial fellow of Jesus College. My research is on scalable methods and flexible models for spatiotemporal statistics and Bayesian machine learning, applied to public policy and social science. Iâ€™ve worked on application areas that include public health, orphanhood, deep learning from satellite and street-level imagery, crime, voting patterns, filter bubbles / echo chambers in media, the big data paradox, the regulation of machine learning algorithms, and emotion.

 
I am working with colleagues from University of Oxford, Imperial College London, and University of Copenhagen to model the spread of COVID-19.
