I am a Research Assistant at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at NUS. My work focuses on using phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses to infer properties and spatial & temporal patterns of infectious diseases. I am using these analyses to better understand dengue in Singapore. I also have some experience working with GWAS and synthetic health data generation.
