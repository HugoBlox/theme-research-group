Robert is a PhD student in Nanoengineering at UC San Diego, co-advised by Prof. Tod Pascal and Prof. Darren Lipomi, working on atomistic simulations of polymer systems, polymer-bio interfaces for Engineered Living Materials, and other organic molecular systems. He is interested in using simulation as a computational microscope to understand nanoscale phenomena, and in high-throughput endeavors toward materials design. Robert is also interested in creating platforms for more efficient research and education, particularly in making use of LLMs to do so. Robert collaborates extensively with the Laboratory for Emerging Intelligence in the CSE department of UC San Diego and with Prof. Moon Sung Kang at Sogang University, and was previously a guest researcher in the group of Prof. Bill Goddard at the California Institute of Technology. Robert earned his B.S. in Nanoengineering and his B.A. in Chinese Studies from UC San Diego in 2020. He studied abroad at Fudan University in Shanghai in 2017, and speaks Mandarin. Robert is a MRSEC-supported trainee in IRG-2 of UC San Diego's MRSEC (NSF Award Number DMR-2011924).
