I am an undergraduate student currently undertaking an internship at UCSD. I am part of a project focused on studying computational materials, specifically involved in developing electrochemical cells using quantum mechanics and SIESTA software. Our main objective is to understand the electrode-electrolyte interface through advanced computer simulations.
