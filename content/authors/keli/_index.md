I was formerly a Member of the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, and received my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, where I was advised by Jitendra Malik, and my bachelor's in computer science from the University of Toronto. My research interests are in machine learning, computer vision and algorithms.
