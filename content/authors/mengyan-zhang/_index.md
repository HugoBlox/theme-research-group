I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Dr. Seth Flaxman. Before that, I did my PhD at the Australian National University and Data61, CSIRO (awarded 2023.02), under the supervision of Dr. Cheng Soon Ong, Prof. Lexing Xie and Prof. Eduardo Eyras. My research interests are online experimental design in machine learning, including multi-armed bandits and active learning. I work on both theoretical and practical views of experimental design with two goals: (I) Designing adaptive strategies for imperfect feedback. Understanding the concentration of measures and adaptive strategies involved. (II) Designing the pipeline and recommendation strategies from a practical point of view, including applications in survey design, global health and biology.
