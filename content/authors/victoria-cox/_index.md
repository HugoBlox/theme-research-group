My research focuses on the impact of climate on the spread of arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, zika, and West Nile virus. I am interested in the seasonality and heterogeneity of arbovirus transmission across space and time, and the interplay between environment, climate, human and vector populations which drives this.
