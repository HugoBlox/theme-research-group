We are involved in a number of multinational data-driven public health projects. I co-lead the Phylogenetics and Networks of Generalised HIV epidemics in Africa, and my group develops statistical methods to analyse [HIV deep sequence data](https://www.pangea-hiv.org). I am a member of the Global Reference Group for [children affected by COVID-19](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/the-global-reference-group-on-children-affected-by-covid-19) and help develop methods to quantify the number of children who lost their parents or caregivers to COVID-19. My group works closely with [Emodo Inc.](https://www.emodoinc.com) to harness global mobile phone device data for public good. I am the lead statistician of the LONGVIEW study at the [Rakai Health Sciences Program](https://www.rhsp.org/). We are affiliated with the HIV transmission elimination initiative Amsterdam and have joined forces for a future with no new HIV infections (https://hteam.nl).
