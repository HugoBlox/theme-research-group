I develop bespoke statistical methods for public good.

I am particularly interested in novel Bayesian methods that harness information in viral deep sequence data, mobile phone mobility data, and time-resolved patient data to characterise the spread of infectious diseases, and to guide public health interventions. 

My group and I are involved in a number of multinational public health projects. See my research page for details:
