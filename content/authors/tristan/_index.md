Iâ€™m a PhD student at Simon Fraser University, advised by Professor [Ke Li](http://www.sfu.ca/~keli/). I'm interested in understanding self-supervised learning with perspectives from generative models and increasingly category theory. I received my undergraduate degree at Cornell University, where I was advised by [Bharath Hariharan](http://home.bharathh.info/) and [Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/).
