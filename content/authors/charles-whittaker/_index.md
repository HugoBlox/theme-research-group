My work involves modelling infectious disease transmission dynamics, across a range of different systems that to date have included malaria, loiasis, ebola and COVID-19. Broader research interests include include disease ecology, the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases, surveillance system design and mitigating globally catastrophic biological risks.
