My research programme is focused on studying the evolution and epidemiology of rapidly evolving viruses that circulate in human and animal populations, such as SARS-CoV-2, yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika and dengue. Current research topics include: epidemiology, evolution and phylodynamics of viral epidemics; local and regional genomic capacity and outbreak preparedness; and implementation of One Health approaches in hotspots of emerging infectious diseases.

I coordinate the Brazil-UK CADDE Centre (Centre for Arbovirus Discovery, Diagnostics, Genomics and Epidemiology) with Prof. Ester Sabino from the University of SÃ£o Paulo. In February 2020, CADDE led the initiative that resulted in the generation, analysis and report of the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Latin America in <48 hours. Our team then provided early insights into the epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and uncovered a three-quarters attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazon region by October 2020. In January 2021, our team discovered the first cases of the SARS-CoV-2 Gamma variant of concern in Manaus. I also lead the ArboSPREAD project, a network for surveillance of arbovirus spread and persistence across corridors of ecological suitability between Angola and Brazil that characterised a Zika outbreak caused by Asian genotype lineage in Angola. I have previously co-led the ZiBRA project in northeast Brazil for real-time genome sequencing of Zika virus in Brazil.
