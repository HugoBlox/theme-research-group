# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research is focussed on the transmission, prevention and alleviation of infectious disease. I use a combination of mathematical, statistical and computational models to study a variety of viruses, including dengue, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and in recent years COVID-19. Since the pandemic, I have been especially interested in pandemic preparedness and emerging threats to human health.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis), based at the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology. My research is focussed on the transmission, prevention and alleviation of infectious disease. I use a combination of mathematical, statistical and computational models to study a variety of viruses, including dengue, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and in recent years COVID-19. Since the pandemic, I have been especially interested in pandemic preparedness and emerging threats to human health.
