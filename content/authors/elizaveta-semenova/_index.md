My background is in Bayesian modelling of spatiotemporal disease surveillance and environmental data, including point pattern data analysis and detection of hotspots on gridded surfaces. Currently, I am interested in using deep generative modelling to power MCMC inference in classical spatial statistics, as well as adaptive survey design.
