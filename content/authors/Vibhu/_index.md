Sergio is a Materials Science and Engineering PhD student at UC San Diego, specializing in the application of quantum mechanical and force field methods to investigate solid/liquid interfaces relevant to electrochemistry. Currently, Sergio is immersed in copper electrodeposition simulations, aligning his research with the latest experimental endeavors of collaborators who employ cutting-edge X-ray techniques to explore interfaces. Sergio earned his B.S. in Chemistry in 2019 and obtained a second B.S. in Physics in 2021 from Universidad de los Andes, Colombia.
