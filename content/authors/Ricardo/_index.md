Ricardo is a 2nd year PhD student developing a computational characterization software for polymers. His high-throughput work analyzes the mechanical properties of any polymer composition with a universal machine-learned forcefield for increased accuracy while maintaining a small computational cost. Ricardo loves surfing - despite not being too good at it - and playing/listening to punk rock music. Fun fact: he was featured on a video clip of his favorite band, Green Day.
