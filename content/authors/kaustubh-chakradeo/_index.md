I am a PhD candidate at the Section of Epidemiology of the University of Copenhagen. My PhD is based on deep learning based medical imaging analysis, focusing on infectious diseases like malaria. My primary interest is using artificial intelligence with medical imaging modalities, for infectious diseases. I am also interested in the law and ethics of AI technologies, with a focus on their use for minority groups.
