I am working as a Research Fellow at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/). My primary work focuses on developing a Bayesian framework to model spatio-temporal disease propagation. In this process, I am interested in exploring the effect of human mobility on the disease spread.
